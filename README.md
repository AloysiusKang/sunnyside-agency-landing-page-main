## Overview

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) - JS library

### What I learned
I Learned to use BEM writing correctly or atleast better than the other challenges or projects that I have done before. Also in this project I tried doing the mobile first solution rather than doing desktop first. Not only that I also tried to be as minimal as posible when it comes to giving styles to an element so that I do not specify stylings that are not needed.

### Continued development
I would like to continue to get more comfortable in working mobile first and using var() if needed. Also try to improve in my javascript by challenging myself to more JS orientated projects or challenges.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset by Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped reseting my css.
- [anime.js library](https://animejs.com/) - This is a JS library that I use for animating my dropdown. It helped me animate elements easier.
